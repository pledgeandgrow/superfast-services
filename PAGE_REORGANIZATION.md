# Page Reorganization Summary

## Components Moved from Home to Services

The following components have been moved from `components/home/` to `components/services/`:

1. **DetailedServicesSection** - Detailed service offerings with images
2. **ProcessSection** - 9-step methodology process
3. **SecteursSection** - Industry sectors served
4. **FAQSection** - Frequently asked questions

## Updated Pages

### Home Page (`/app/page.tsx`)

**Removed Components:**
- ❌ DetailedServicesSection
- ❌ ProcessSection
- ❌ SecteursSection
- ❌ FAQSection

**Current Structure:**
1. Header
2. HeroSection
3. PartnersSection
4. ServicesSection
5. MissionSection
6. TestimonialsSection
7. ContactSection
8. Footer

### Services Page (`/app/services/page.tsx`)

**Added Components:**
- ✅ DetailedServicesSection
- ✅ ProcessSection
- ✅ SecteursSection
- ✅ FAQSection

**Current Structure:**
1. Header
2. ServicesHero
3. ServicesGrid
4. ServicesFeatures
5. DetailedServicesSection *(moved from home)*
6. ProcessSection *(moved from home)*
7. SecteursSection *(moved from home)*
8. FAQSection *(moved from home)*
9. ServicesCTA
10. Footer

## Rationale

This reorganization improves the user experience by:

1. **Streamlined Home Page** - Focuses on core value proposition and quick overview
2. **Comprehensive Services Page** - Provides detailed information about services, process, sectors, and FAQs in one place
3. **Better Information Architecture** - Users looking for detailed service information find everything on the services page
4. **Improved Navigation Flow** - Natural progression from home overview to detailed services information

## Component Locations

### Home Components (`components/home/`)
- HeroSection.tsx
- PartnersSection.tsx
- ServicesSection.tsx
- MissionSection.tsx
- TestimonialsSection.tsx
- ContactSection.tsx

### Services Components (`components/services/`)
- ServicesHero.tsx
- ServicesGrid.tsx
- ServicesFeatures.tsx
- DetailedServicesSection.tsx *(moved)*
- ProcessSection.tsx *(moved)*
- SecteursSection.tsx *(moved)*
- FAQSection.tsx *(moved)*
- ServicesCTA.tsx
- ServicesProcess.tsx *(alternative 4-step process, not currently used)*

## Notes

- `ServicesProcess.tsx` is a simpler 4-step process component that's currently not in use
- `ProcessSection.tsx` is the detailed 9-step process now used on the services page
- All imports have been updated in both pages
- No duplicate components exist - clean separation between home and services
